## This tool will take screenshots by puppeteer
giving list of url, list of resolution, folder name

```const urlList = [
            { name: "about", link: "http://www.teaching.com.au/page/mta-about" }
];
const deviceList = [
            { name: "desktop", width: 1360, height: 768 },
            { name: "tablet", width: 768, height: 1024 },
            { name: "mobile", width: 360, height: 640 }
